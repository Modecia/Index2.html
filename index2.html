        <h1><b><i>Science Elevation From History</i></b></h1>
        <p>Science has improved over time same as computers. Over time we have seen machines invented
            to quicken the way people do their work.For example,computers where created to easy man's 
            work to help them calculate and keep their documents and other machines etc.
        </p>

            <dt>Computers:</dt>
                      <dd>They were made easy to use and easy to communicate with the user</dd>
        <br />
            <dt>Sowing Machines:</dt>
                      <dd>Sowing machines were made and they made it easy to make clothes cause
                          before the machines were made people made clothes using needles and it 
                          was hurting their fingers.And it took a long time to make just a piece 
                          of cloth but now clothes are made very fast because the machines were 
                          made.
                          </dd>
        <br />
            <dt>Electric Iron Bars:</dt>
                      <dd>Before the electric iron bars were made people used to light up coal
                          and put it in the iron bar and they had to wait for it to get hot so 
                          they can iron their clothes and they would waste alot of time waiting
                          for the iron bar to get hot and the iron bar did not have where you can
                          decrease or increase heat.But when the electric iron bars were made people
                          iron their clothes fast and they can <strong>increase or decrease</strong>
                          heat of the iron bar.
                          </dd>
        <br />
            <dt>Xrays:</dt>
                       <dd>Xrays were made to help doctors to see what is inside a <stong>human's</stong>
                           body so that they can know what is wrong with a person before they operate them.
                           But before the xray was made, it was hard for the doctors to know what is wrong in the 
                           human body.If the had internal pain.
                           </dd>
        <br />
            <dt>Digging Tractors:</dt>
                        <dd>Those days before the digging tractors were made,it would take alot of <strong>man power</strong>
                            and alot of time to dig one piece of land.But when the tractors were made it only
                            the person to operate it to do the work of many men in one day.
                        </dd>
        <br />
            <dt>Ploughing Machines:</dt>
                        <dd>Similar to the <strong>Digging tractors</strong> this ploughing machine before it was invented
                            it took alot of man power and people to plsnt seeds in a land but this changed when this machine
                            was invented.</dd>
