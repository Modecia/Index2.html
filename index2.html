            <dt>Sowing Machines:</dt>
                      <dd>Sowing machines were made and they made it easy to make clothes cause
                          before the machines were made people made clothes using needles and it 
                          was hurting their fingers.And it took a long time to make just a piece 
                          of cloth but now clothes are made very fast because the machines were 
                          made.
